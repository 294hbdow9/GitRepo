            <p class="tab"><b>I watched <b>Parasite</b> a very long time ago with my sister and I was thinking about rewatching it again because I remembered how exciting it was the first time around. <b>Parasite</b> is a good film because of how it deals with issues like class inequality and the wealth gap. It was interesting to see how the director choose to tell a story about between a rich family and a less fortunate one. The film leaves you with a desire to speak to others about the issues mentioned and it does it in a captivating way.</b></p>
            <p class="tab"><b>I remember the film brought a lot of discussusion surrounding topics such as class discrimination and inequality. The actors were also very good at portraying their characters which made it really entertaining all throughout.</b></p>
            <p class="tab"><b>Who doesn't love a good commentary on the world?</b></p>
